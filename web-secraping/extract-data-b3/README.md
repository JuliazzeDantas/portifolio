# Brazilian Stocks Data Extractor
## Purpose
This project was designed to extract valuation data of companies listed on B3 (the Brazilian stock exchange).

## How It Works
The script opens a browser and fetches data from the Status Invest website. After that, it builds a JSON with the information and prints it on the screen.

## How to Run the Project
### Print to Screen

`git clone https://github.com/JuliazzeDantas/portifolio/tree/main/web-secraping/extract-data-b3`

`source venv/bin/activate`

`python3 scrape_data.py <brasilian_stock>`

It will return a JSON with valuation data from this stock
